Welcome to the Spelling Quiz! app for Android

This is an open source Android app with source code available on GitHub; the app is also available on Google Play.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data created by the you is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

If you find any security vulnerability let me know by my email stevenotarkson@gmail.com and I will get back to you as soon as possible.

Thank you
